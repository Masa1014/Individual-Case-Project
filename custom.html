  <h2> Japanese Customs and Manners </h2>
  <p>This page introduces some Japanese customs and manners. Japanese customs and manners are unique and very complex, so I am sure they are very different from your country's customs and manners.
  </p>

  <h2>1.Table manner</h2>
  <div id="itadaki">
  <p>The Japanese say "Itadakimasu" before meals, which is a culture unique to Japan. Before eating, we says this to thank the people who cooked the food, the people who raised the ingredients, and the ingredients themselves. The greeting "Gochisousama deshita" after a meal can be thought of as expressing gratitude like a greeting before a meal.
  </p>
  </div>

  <h2>2.Bowing</h2>
  <div id="ozigi">
  <p>In Japan, people greet each other by bowing to one another.
     In modern day Japan, bowing has several different uses. Bowing in Japan is now used to thank, request, congratulate, and apologize to others. Itâ€™s become an essential cultural tool that everyone in Japan is taught to execute properly, from children to company workers.

  <h2>3.Shoes</h2>
  <div id="shoes">
  <p>Shoes are never worn in someone's home or on Japanese tatami flooring (mats). It is expected to take off your shoes in a restaurant, hotel, hot spring resort etc. There will always be a place to put your shoes. In addition, you will be given slippers to wear. There are often different slippers for the bathroom. You should never wear the normal slippers into the bathroom (if bathroom slippers are provided) and vice versa.
