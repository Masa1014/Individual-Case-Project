  <h2> What is your favorite Japanese food ? </h2>
  <p> Speaking of Japanese food that foreign tourists visit and praise in Japan, there are various dishes from popular and famous Japanese food such as
      Sushi and Teriyaki to unique food that you do not know.
      On this page, I will introduce seven Japanese foods that you should definitely try.</p><br>

   <h2>1.Ramen</h2>
   <div id="ramen"></div>
   <p>Ramen is highly regarded by foreign tourists. The reasons are "delicious" and "fresh ingredients",  "dishes that cannot be tasted in your own country" and "traditional and unique to Japan". At ramen shops all over Japan, you can enjoy unique and unique tastes, and the good cost performance is another reason why it is popular with foreigners.
   </p><br>

   <h2>2. Tempura</h2>
   <div id="tempura"></div>
   <p>Like sushi, tempura is a popular food among Japanese people.
      empura is made by covering fish and vegetables with a special tempura dough and fried until it becomes crispy and pale golden. Also, vegetarians can eat it, so it is a highly recommended food.
   </p><br>

   <h2>3. Udon</h2>
   <div id="udon"></div>
   <p>The Japanese food I would like to recommend to you most is udon, because I think udon is one of the most healthy and reasonably priced Japanese foods. Udon is thick and chewy, traditionally made from flour and salt water, and the soup uses seafood and chicken. Also there are many types of udon, but the one I recommend most is beef udon.
